** About

This Emacs package provides minor-mode for prettifying [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/][Guix]] / [[http://nixos.org/][Nix]] store
paths by replacing SHA-sequences with ellipsis, i.e.:

: /gnu/store/72f54nfp6g1hz873w8z3gfcah0h4nl9p-foo-0.1  →  /gnu/store/…-foo-0.1
: /nix/store/nh4n4yzb1bx7nss2rg342dz44g14m06x-bar-0.2  →  /nix/store/…-bar-0.2

** Installation

*** Automatic

This package is avalable on [[http://melpa.milkbox.net][MELPA]].

*** Manual

As usual for the manual installation, add a directory with
=pretty-sha-path.el= to the =load-path= and add necessary autoloads:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/pretty-sha-path")
(autoload 'pretty-sha-path-mode "pretty-sha-path" nil t)
(autoload 'pretty-sha-path-global-mode "pretty-sha-path" nil t)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

- Enable/disable prettifying for the current buffer:
  : M-x pretty-sha-path-mode

- Enable/disable prettifying globally:
  : M-x pretty-sha-path-global-mode

Using programmatically in your emacs init file:

- Enable only for some modes:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'pretty-sha-path-mode)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'pretty-sha-path-mode)
  #+END_SRC

- Or enable globally on emacs start:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (pretty-sha-path-global-mode)
  #+END_SRC

** Why?

So why does this package exist if there is a more general solution –
[[http://github.com/drothlis/pretty-symbols][pretty-symbols]]?  =pretty-symbols= has 2 disadvantages (IMHO):

- It is not possible to enable it globally.
- Decomposition does not occur after disabling the mode, i.e. the paths
  would stay "prettified".

So if you are not going to disable it and use it globally, then
=pretty-symbols-mode= will probably be a better call.

/Note:/ There is also =prettify-symbols-mode= which is a part of Emacs
24.4.  It is great for prettifying symbols (like "lambda") but it does
not support regexps.
